Part of Udacity Nanodegree

## Environment
The aim of this project is to train an agent to navigate collect yellow bananas while avoiding blue bananas.A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:

0 - move forward.
1 - move backward.
2 - turn left.
3 - turn right.


The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.


## Getting started
Activate the environment:

Please follow the instructions in the following GitHub repository https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies to set up your Python environment. By following these instructions, you will install all the Python packages required to complete the project.

(For Windows users) The ML-Agents toolkit supports Windows 10. While it might be possible to run the ML-Agents toolkit using other versions of Windows, it has not been tested on other versions. Furthermore, the ML-Agents toolkit has not been tested on a Windows VM such as Bootcamp or Parallels.

Download the environment from one of the links below. You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
Windows (64-bit): https://github.com/anupamshandilya92/Navigation/blob/main/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip
For Windows users) Check out this link if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

Place the file in the DRLND GitHub repository, in the p1_navigation/ folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file.

## Instructions
Follow the instructions in Navigation.ipynb to get started with training your own agent!
